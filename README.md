# online_lb_frontend

This is the last half of the Online Library project.

Whilst I worked on the backend, I need a way for users to access it, hence the front end.

Now, the project is taking the shape of a mobile application written in Kotlin for Android Devices.

The mobile application has a login form alongside a sign up form (coming soon).

After the user is registered, the user can use ha bottom navigation toolbar to navigate between their profile, browsing books and checking their history of borrowed books.

When checking their profile, the user can decide to update their personal information by clicking the edit profile button. After they're done, they can click on the update button to send the new info to the program or revert to cancel the update (coming soon).

Borrowed books & Browse books - same idea, take the rows from the DB - implement search option to find a title (coming soon).


TO DO:
login & sign up
revert changes button for profile
get books from DB and send them to the app
implement search field for books
logout
